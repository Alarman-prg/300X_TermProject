        <h2>Product Edit/Creation Admin Tool Page</h2>
        <p>
        A product edit page is needed to allow users to modify details of a product. All the fields (except the product id)
        should be editable on this page. Product image should just be a field, we will assume that the image is already
        on the server. This page should also allow for users to select the product they want to edit from a list of all
        products that they can filter by searching for a specific product or category. The page should also allow them to
        add a new product that does not exist. A product should have the following attributes, in addition to other
        attributes unique to your product:</br>
            • Product id (not editable)
            • Name
            • Description
            • Category id (or name)
            • Image path
            • Price
