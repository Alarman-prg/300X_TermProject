        <h2>Bulk Upload Admin Tool Page</h2>
        <pre>
            Using this page, an admin user can select a file with bulk product data in JSON format (or more such as csv or text)
            and upload it into the database. This page should have a form field to select a file to upload.
            This form should also have a submit button to allow them to upload the file. This part of the page should have an example
            file format so they know what format the data should be in and instructions for the type of files that you accept.
